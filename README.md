# setup-mc

Minecraft Server Setup Script made in Rust

## How to run

The easiest way to run this app is to get a prebuilt version from the [releases](https://github.com/kattschan/setup-mc/releases/). There are builds for Windows and Linux x64. If you can't use these builds (for example, Ubuntu 22.04 does not include libssl3) or would like to build from source:

0. Install Rust

   Visit https://rustup.rs/ to install Rust for your system.

1. Acquire the code

   Clone the code (`git clone https://github.com/kattschan/setup-mc`) or download the ZIP from the green button at the top

2. Run the code

   Open a command prompt or terminal in the folder you placed the code in, then run `cargo build --release` or `cargo run`.

<sup><sub><sup>This is my first Rust app and I am told the code quality reflects that</sup></sub></sup>
